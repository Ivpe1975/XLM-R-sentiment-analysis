      "I had two reasons to love Being Brooke. I like watching best friends fall in love! My daughter and I represent two generations of women who married their best friends.; and my granddaughter just announced that she and her best friend are starting to date! My last name is Barker(a name given to me by my late husband). I nearly gave up on this book because this Brooke was broken. She wasn't quirky, she was just queer! The only thing I could work out about her was on the autism spectrum. That's understandable! Crazy for no reason is not! \n",

      "This purchase is a gift for someone that has been unopened so my review is based on my experiences with the product. My first issue in this experience is pricing. From this listing it costs about store price (still too much), but purchased from the company who makes it it is double for some reason. It's a fun toy, but overpriced since you can make your own slime cheaper and better. I only purchased this for the cute elements and because it was a gift I was willing to spend a little more. I figured even if the slime was a failure, at least there was some fun opening and having the keychains. I also purchased other items as further backup in case it doesn't turn out right. The product itself has a fun blind bag element with cute keychains and mystery scents which besides the marketing is probably the best part. I already mentioned that was enough of a fallback that even if the slime comes out dissapointing, the kid will still have fun with it. The slime quality with these is very hit or miss. Sometimes it comes out well and others it does not. Sometimes it gets better with time and others it deteriorates. This product is a gamble and the only thing making it almost worth it are the little blind box toys. I'm sure this young kid will have fun with it, but all factors included it isn't worth returning and also not worth rebuying. \n",

      "This hair is good but I had a few issues. Pros: The shipping was super-fast. I received it in two days with Prime and it was a weekend when I ordered. (Sat. got it on Mon). It is soft and very manageable. Holds curls very well. Does not have such a bad smell. Cons: It sheds a lot. Straight out the pack just running my hand through there was shedding. After I was washed it even more shedding. There was rust in the hair. Yes, that’s right RUST. Perhaps it’s from being stored for a long time but the combs were rusty. Even some parts of the lace had rust on it. This is very disappointing but you get what you pay for. I had a wedding to go to last minute so I thoroughly washed it and even disinfected it with Lysol. I also bought some wig combs to sew them in myself, instead of using the rusty one attached to the wig. Lol, Desperate times calls for desperate measures. I knew I would not be able to get my money back after cutting the lace and sewing clips in so I didn’t bother sending it back. The pics here. The hair is beautiful when styled and holds curls very well. To be honest, if this hair didn’t shed or have rust in it, I would rate it 5 stars. Unfortunately, paying $100 for hair I do not expect it to be rusty. I had to buy separate wig combs and sew them in myself so I don’t get the rust in my own hair and scalp. That was doing a lot. Hope you guys have better luck than I did. This hair really has the potential to be great though. \n",
